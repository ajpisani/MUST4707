    <p>
      This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are defined with the
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.

    <!-- Section for headings -->
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings are used to structure your content hierarchically. There are six
      levels of headings in HTML:
    </p>
    <!-- Example of each heading level -->
    <h1>H1: Main heading, highest level</h1>
    <p>
      The H1 tag is typically used for the main title of the page. It's the
      highest level heading and should be used for main headings only.
    </p>
    <h2>H2: Used for major section headings</h2>
    <p>
      H2 tags are used for major sections of your page. They serve as
      subheadings to the H1 tag and help organize content into manageable
      sections.
    </p>
    <h3>H3: Subsections under H2 headings</h3>
    <p>
      Use H3 tags for subsections within an H2 section. They help further
      organize content that falls under the same major section.
    </p>
    <h4>H4: Further subsections or points under H3</h4>
    <p>
      H4 tags are used for further dividing sections under H3 headings, ideal
      for topics that require a more detailed level of hierarchy.
    </p>
    <h5>H5: Detail under H4 headings</h5>
    <p>
      H5 tags are used for detailed points under an H4 section. They are less
      commonly used but are helpful for deep content structure.
    </p>
    <h6>H6: The lowest level heading</h6>
    <p>
      H6 tags are used for the lowest level headings. They can be used for minor
      headings under H5 or for footnotes.
    </p>
